- 1 active request per IP? => adapt canary tests
- CORS? Need to do some research
- canary tests
  - convert
  - zipper
- GSI (PK: IP, sort key: createdAt) to soft limit number of requests per day? (100?)
- global rate limiting per IP probably through WAF which sits in front of API gateway   
  - has to be complementary with GSI as WAF min threshold to start block is 100 requests per 5 min
  - benefits:
    - WAF blocks the requests and lambdas don't have to take the load (only 1000 max concurrent exec per account per region)
    - WAF also has managed rules which prevents us from common vulnerabilities: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/waf/latest/developerguide/aws-managed-rule-groups-baseline.html 
- unit tests
- integ tests
- shared layers for common code
- maybe only change back to original-name at the archive step, does it really matter though? Maybe can keep original name all along
- for optimistic locking instead of always doing exponential backoff
  - try immediate retries
  - if that fails, try with jitter delay
  - if that fails, try with jitter + exponential backoff
- client, fix the dropdown not saving state
- Jpg to png + jpg to gif extremely slow, doesn't finish in 50s, remove that option
