- use s3 SSE encryption
- use DDB to track status instead of file based stuff
- use DDB to count and limit 200 max files per request
- Add lambda to generate request uuid and store it somehow
- make presign lambda check if requestId is a valid one
- change getStatus to a GET request with query param
- TTL of DDB and S3
- 1 request per IP, rate limit
- CORS to localhost:3000 (look at strategies here) + own url when hosted
- requests validation from API gateway
